This plugin will allow me to access the native camera on the user’s device within my application. After adding the code within my project, I can add the specific platforms that I need meaning I can target multiple operating systems so the plugin can work on multiple devices. After that, I add the plugin to search for the native camera when called upon in the app. Cordova also allows you to use merges to customize each platform so it can make certain changes depending on which device the user has.
