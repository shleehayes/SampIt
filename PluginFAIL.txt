Implementing a Cordova Camera Plugin using PhoneGap.

Being that we tried so many different things to try and make the plugin work, I’m going to describe the process as best I can. 

      After researching the Cordova camera plugin, I read through the documentation to see what code I needed to add to my project in order to make the plugin work. I made an icon button on the page where the plugin would be used, which was on “swatches”.  I added a config.xml file which contains the version of the plugin and widget information that includes: a name tag where the title of the app goes, a description for the app, and an author tag to put your website and email, and lastly the plugin name. I then made an app.js file which would host my jQuery code specifically for the Cordova plugin.  I called the ID of the button I made previously which was “#camera_button”, on “click” the button should have brought the native camera up on the mobile device because of the “.getPicture(onSuccess, onFail) function. Unfortunately, even after moving all the files into a phoneGap project and trying over and over again, the plugin did not work. I then followed the video sent to me where instructor links a cordova.js file to his index.html file and uses the terminal to initialize the Cordova camera plugin before previewing it on phoneGap. I did this, initializing the iOS camera plugin so I could preview it on my phone but yet again, the plugin still didn’t work. Apparently Adobe changed the way phoneGap works and has left me with no plugin! The search continues …
